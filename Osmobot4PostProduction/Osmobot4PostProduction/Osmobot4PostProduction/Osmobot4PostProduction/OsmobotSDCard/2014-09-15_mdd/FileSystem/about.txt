This folder holds a simplified version of Microchip's MDD filesystem.  It was
simplified for CCS C Customers who wanted to use this filesystem in simple
projects without having to use a linker.

To use the MDD library, #include /filesystem/filesystem.h and #include
/filesystem/filesystem.c your project.

The API is the same as Microchip's MDD, refer to their documentation for 
support.

To configure the MDD library, you have to edit HardwareProfile.h (this contains
hardware configuration such as I/O pins and SPI port) and FSconfig.h (this 
contains software configuration options).

To prevent recursion, some FAT12 code was commented out - therefore FAT12 is
not supported in the CCS C Compiler.

Be aware that using this library changes some properties of the CCS compiler:
   * Case sensitivity is turned on
   * int=16 bits, long=32 bits.  You can still use int8, int16 and int32.
   * integers are signed by default.
   * #DEVICE PASS_STRINGS=IN_RAM (see compiler manual).
   * #DEVICE CONST=READ_ONLY (see compiler manual. 
         For PIC18 Only, NOT dsPIC/PIC24).

This port of MDD is based on MDD 1.4.2 from Microchip Application Libraries
