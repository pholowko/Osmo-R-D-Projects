MPLAB/MPLAB X -> CCS PJT Converter

- Copy ProjectConverter.exe to the same directory as the compiler (ex. C:\Program Files\PICC)

- Run ProjectConverter.exe

- Use the directory box to select the directory of the project you wish to convert.

- When a MPLAB/MPLAB X project is discovered, it will be displayed in the "Projects" box.

- The available devices for the selected project will be displayed in the "Devices" box.

- The "Convert" button will become active when a project and device are selected.

- Selecting the "Save With Project" radio button will cause the PJT to be built and saved 
  in the same directory as the MPLAB/MPLAB X project (any relative file paths in the 
  project will be left as is).

- Selecting the "Choose Save Location" radio button will cause a save directory prompt
  to appear when the "Convert" button is pressed. Select the folder that you wish to save 
  the project in. (Any relative file paths in the project are converted to absolute paths
  so PCW can find the files even if they are not in the same directory as the PJT)

- Clicking the "Convert" button will display the project, save location, and device 
  selected and will ask the user to confirm these settings. Pressing "OK" will start the 
  conversion.

- The output box at the bottom of the program displays the status messages, errors, and 
  warnings generated during the conversion.

- After the conversion is complete, the generated .PJT can then be opened in PCW.
